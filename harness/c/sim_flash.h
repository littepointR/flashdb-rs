/*
 * RAM-backed NOR flash simulator for the C reference benchmark harness.
 *
 * Semantics (see harness/SCENARIOS.md and harness/c/README.md):
 *   - 32 KiB of simulated NOR, 4096-byte erase blocks.
 *   - Reads copy bytes.
 *   - Writes can only clear bits (1 -> 0). If a write tries to set a bit
 *     (0 -> 1) the stored byte is the AND of old and new data, exactly like
 *     real NOR, and the attempt is counted in sim_nor_set_bit_attempts().
 *   - Erases must be block aligned / block sized and set the range to 0xFF.
 *   - Every successful read/write/erase op is counted, plus the byte volume,
 *     so benchmark phases can report flash traffic exactly as the protocol
 *     requires: reads, read_bytes, writes, write_bytes, erases, erase_bytes.
 *
 * Fault injection: sim_fault_arm(n) lets the next n flash ops succeed and makes
 * every following op fail (-1, no state change) until sim_fault_clear(). This
 * is the power-cut hook used by the interrupted-operation equivalence tests.
